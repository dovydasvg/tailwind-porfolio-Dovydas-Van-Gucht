# Who am I?

I'm a human, who wants to create and make the world a better place. I materialize this by developing useful products and teaching others. üí°

### I care to

* **Deliver, no excuses.** It might not be perfect but it must be delivered.
* **Keep it simple.** Focus on making things work, don't overcomplicate it.
* **Take time to understand.** Don't rush into conclusions or building. Understanding your client and your product takes time - take it.

I'm a strong believer in life-long learning, therefore if you've got something interesting to share - [jot me a line](#stay-in-touch). üñäÔ∏è

Enjoy this portfolio and perhaps - talk to you soon!

# I created

## a course management system - _Klases.lt_

It's a simple course management system to showcase my knowledge in Laravel and Livewire. I resell the system.

## a book - _Learn Your English_

I wrote this book to summarize my experience in teaching English. It's a guide on how to learn and improve your English skills on your own. The book focuses on the psychological and technological aspects of learning a language. It was published in 2020 and now [can be found](https://www.knygos.lt/lt/knygos/learn-your-english--paskutine-knyga--kurios-tau-reikes-mokantis-anglu-kalbos/) in most book shops around Lithuania.

## a startup - _12classrooms_

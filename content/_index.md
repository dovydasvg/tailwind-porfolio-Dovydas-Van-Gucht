# Who am I?

I'm a human, who wants to create and make the world a better place. I materialize this by developing useful products and teaching others. üí°

### I care to

* **Deliver, no excuses.** It might not be perfect but it must be delivered.
* **Keep it simple.** Focus on making things work, don't overcomplicate it.
* **Take time to understand.** Don't rush into conclusions or building. Understanding your client and your product takes time - take it.

I'm a strong believer in life-long learning, therefore if you've got something interesting to share - [jot me a line](#stay-in-touch). üñäÔ∏è

# What do I know?

Besides various lifehacks, I've got some sellable knowledge/skills - here they are.

## Full-Stack Development

I can create full web apps or a simple website. Let's have a chat to see what would be the best option for you. Here are the technologies I love:

### PHP / Laravel

To manage the backend of applications. Mostly for managing data, but can be used alone for quick MVP making. In combination with Livewire and AlpineJS for one-man projects.

### VueJS

Currently using Vue 3 in combination with Typescript and Laravel. Using it to create single-page apps.

### Tailwind CSS

To make things beautiful.

### HUGO

Perfect for creating static pages and deploy them on Netlify. (Like this page) Using it mostly for my own projects.

### WordPress

Fantastic CMS - easy to use and simple to install. I use it for landing pages of small businesses that want to have a CMS.

## Teaching

I teach English and Business. I primarily work with adults and teenagers. It's a wonderful job to learn patience and understand human psychology.

## Business Development

I used to work in business development, had my own startups, and consulted other businesses. I love to get a product from an idea to the market.

## Writing

I'm a published/featured author in The Startup and Medium.  I worked as a freelance copywriter to sharpen my skills. To top it up, I wrote my own book about learning English and I'm currently working on my next one.

## _Hobbies_

**_Wireframing with Figma_**

**_Filming and Editing videos_**

**_Drawing_**

## a book

## _Learn Your English_

I wrote this book to summarize my experience in teaching English. It's a guide on how to learn and improve your English skills on your own. The book focuses on the psychological and technological aspects of learning a language. It was published in 2020 and now [can be found](https://www.knygos.lt/lt/knygos/learn-your-english--paskutine-knyga--kurios-tau-reikes-mokantis-anglu-kalbos/) in most book shops around Lithuania.

## a startup

## _12classrooms_

A marketplace startup to connect teachers with students without the intermediary of a school. The project was selected in the WebSummit's Alpha program. It was the full young startup experience - from building it myself to failing to hire others, and lastly understanding that there is no demand for our product.

# I'm creating

## a task management system with a healthy twist

## _Pomofit_

I'm building a VueJS app to help me stay focused using the Pomodoro method and have healthy breaks to stretch my back and stay healthy.

## a book

## _Untitled_

I'm writing a book about how to sell your ideas in the market and things that I've learned that I wish I knew when I left school. It's mostly for teenagers and my sister, who's currently finishing highschool.

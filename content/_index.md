# Who am I?

I'm a human, who wants to create and make the world a better place. I materialize this by developing useful products and teaching others. üí°

I'm a strong believer in life-long learning, therefore if you've got something interesting to share - [jot me a line](#contact-me). üñäÔ∏è

Enjoy this portfolio and perhaps - talk to you soon!
